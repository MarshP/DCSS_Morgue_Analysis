# DCSS_Morgue_Analysis
A Python program to analyse your DCSS morgue folder, collate metrics, spot patterns and give hints.

**Disclaimer:** If you're here for a useful tool, best turn back now. I'm doing this to help me learn Python; it won't be in any way useful for a long time. Then I'll remove this note.

## Plans for DCSSMA
DCSSMA will start life as a simple script which takes the morgue folder location as a command line arg. It will parse the morgue .txt files and use some pretty blunt regex work to produce some metrics and report them.

Later I hope to add more efficient data handling, more refined analysis, and maybe a gui or interactive file selection shell. Maybe some link to webtiles...
