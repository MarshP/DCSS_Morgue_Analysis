1. Fork, change as you will, submit pull request
2. You can see what shape the code takes - try to play along
3. If the project doesn't like your pull request you've still got a tool you can use, with your improvements, and the project is public domain, so you can always keep your fork updated with further changes you like down the line.
4. But most likely the most you'll get asked is to re-factor.
5. Welcome!
